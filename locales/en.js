    'There’s a plethora of random dynamic wallpaper utilities on the app store, but most are either buggy as crap or locked beyond pointless paywalls. If your search brought you here, believe me, this is leagues beyond any of the other options here and it’s ACTUALLY free, there are no in-app purchases or sneaky paywalls. Amazing selection of wallpapers that get updated fairly regularly, the only thing I would mention is that it’s probably 50% anime and there’s a few wallpapers that are a tad NSFW (but that isn’t related to the quality of the app itself so proceed at your own discernment). Doesn’t have too much of a battery or memory load and works like a charm; it definitely gives Wallpaper Engine on PC a run for its money.',

  comment4: `Versatile, Excellent Value, Works As Expected
    Although many of the desktop and screensaver video loops contain tangible beginnings and ends, some of the videos are seamlessly integrated, and it's these I am grateful for.
   
    The software developers are from Japan, which accounnts for the numerous anime-related clips.
    
    My only wish were that for some of the scenic waterfalls or room scenes, one need not turn off the audio if one doesn't wish to listen to the adaptive sound connected to the clip.
    
    The option to turn off Dynamic Wallpaper's audio is stil there, and that improves the versatility of this app.
    
    5 Stars for a beautifully crafted piece or artwork one can adapt to their desktop.`,

  comment6: `Excellent Live Wallpaper App without an ounce of Regret
  My desktop is no longer lifeless. The high-quality live wallpapers (wp/wps) are truly amazing. I can choose among the multiple wps dynamic, static, music, animated, etc. available. Haven't even gotten through half of them and new ones get added with updates. Best of all, it doesn't occupy much resources on my mac. Granted I got the M1 so the performance impact is hardly noticeable. There are other apps out there, but this is the one to get. I purchased this based on the reviews other users who have tried and compared other apps and highly recommend this one. I purchased it and have absolutely no regrets. Enjoy it!`,

  comment7: `Works well, meh selection window though.
  It works and it works well. Makes my Macbook feel alive. Honestly works better than Wallpaper Engine. Only negative part is the lack of selections. There's a few pages, and 90% of them are anime or japanese girls, borderline porn too, even after unchecking the cute, anime, and gaming filters to remove them, they still show up. Had to search for an entire hour through every single page and only have about 20 to pick from as of now. Wish there were more.`,

  I bought this software because on my Windows computer I had "Wallpaper engine" and wanted to have that same dynamic background styling here on my MacBook Pro, I haven't had any issues with it such as lowered battery life or performance reduction due to having this runnning and don't expect my computer to slow down from this at all. Would recommend if your looking to give your computer a more personalized look! 10/10!!!`,

  comment9: `Big library but limited search function.
  I just downloaded this about a week ago and while I do very much enjoy the wallpapers, I've found that I have to go through page by page rather than specific searches such as "Dragonball Z" or "WLOP" (a particular artist I love the work of).
  Also, some wallpapers have music while others do not. Filtering these into separate categories would be nice too because it can be rather alarming when music suddenly starts playing and I can't initially tell what window or app its coming from.
  Lastly, the Lite app should be replaced by the upgraded app. I had to manually go in to remove the Lite version after upgrading.`,
